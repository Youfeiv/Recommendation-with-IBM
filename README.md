# Recommendation-with-IBM


Overview

This project was concieved in collaboration with Udacity and IBM Watson.
In this project I aim to create a recommendation system for the IBM Watson community. The recommendation system suggests articles for users to interact based on article-user intersections in the community.

Features

The recommender system can make recommendations in a number of ways:

Collaborative Filtering:
Takes into account the similarity of users and recommends the most popular articles read by similar users
Rank Based Recommendations:
the popularity of an article can really only be based on how often an article was interacted with.
Content Based Filtering(Not discussed here):
Produces recommendations based on similarity to material the user has interacted with previously. Utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodology to analyse and rank articles by similarity.
SVD - Matrix Factorization Recommendations:
Utilises matrix operations to recommend
